QCI Agent
---------

QuakeCon Imaging - SNMP Agent

Functions
---------

Delegate MIB to NetSNMP via *AgentX* or *Pass*

    Claim an unused MIB tree and present this via one of the peering
    protocols for SNMP.

Encapsulate SNMP Sets and Gets as functions in a class

    Python up the implementation as a mini-framework. Sub-classing
    *Agent* and defining methods should automatically enable nodes for
    query. This should also allow for things like auto-enumeration of
    the MIB via class introspection.

Async socket server for ui

    Support query of ui internals via optional socket connection.

Spawn ui on demand

    If the UI is not available, we should allow it to be spawned.

Checks to implement
-------------------

* gets

 * Current user / revision (from file)
 * Current match (parse replay filename?)
 * ui status (connected, disconnected)

* sets

 * Save / Load Image (write command file)
 * Reboot Host (client ui, to warn user)
 * Identify host (client ui to flash screen, make noise,
   change box color, etc.)
 * Release / renew IP addr
